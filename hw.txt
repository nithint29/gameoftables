CREATE TABLE Romances (
	name1		CHAR(20),
	surname1	CHAR(20),
	name2		CHAR(20),
	surname2	CHAR(20),
	FOREIGN KEY(name1, surname1) REFERENCES Characters(name, surname),
	FOREIGN KEY(name2, surname2) REFERENCES Characters(name, surname));

NOT EXISTS (
		SELECT name1, surname1, name2, surname2
		FROM Romances
		WHERE surname1 = surname2 )

4) Our code checks, while the romance values are being created, if the surnames match.
If they do, a new romance is rerolled until the surnames do not match. However, if the surnames are "Lannister" or "Targaryen", the surnames are allowed to match, reflecting Game of Thrones' houses.

Also, we provided a function called 'assertion' to verify that the pattern holds. It takes our data as input(potentially after a new tuple has been added) and checks to see if the pattern holds, returning 'REJECT' if the pattern breaks, and 'ACCEPT' if the pattern holds.

***SQL Prototype -- implemented in our python code in function named 'assertion'***

	NOT EXISTS (
		SELECT name1, surname1, name2, surname2

);
